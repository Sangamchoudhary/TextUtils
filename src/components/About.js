        Yokel Local does a few things well on their About Us page: They call out
        who they work with, they tell their story and mission, and they showcase
        the team behind the brand. This last element is key because Yokel Local
        knows that their "vibe" wins over prospective clients. After all, when
        you hire an agency, you're hiring its people. And people have
        personality. Because "Yokel Local" is a bit of a kooky name that gives
        people pause, they poke fun at it by providing the definition, which
        then leads into photos of the team at work (and at play), the agency's
        story, their mission and values, and the people who make the magic
        happen. This magic is included all over the about page as their
        employees make goofy faces, wear ugly Christmas sweaters, and work/play
        hard.
